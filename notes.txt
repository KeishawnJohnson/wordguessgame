create array of names

create function that pulls random index from array

pull characters through a loop for the word chosen in the array

compare letter inputs to letters in word .toLowerCase

general rough thinking:
if user guess equals any character from loop then replace character with user guess 
if not then replace guess log with user guess 

use loop to create an array of letters then use for each to scan and compare each letter to user guess

replacing dashes with letters rough thinking:
create an array for each dash
create a function that replaces each dash with users correct guess

create array for dashes
display dashe array
consistently update dash array with function

if userguess = letters then replace that index in dashes array then display
